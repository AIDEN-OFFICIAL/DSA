# DSA Notes — Strings
## 1. What is a String?

A **String** is a sequence of characters stored in a continuous memory location.

Example:

```
"hello"
"DSA"
"12345"
```

Strings are usually **immutable** in many languages (like Java, Python), meaning they cannot be changed directly; instead, new strings are created.

## 2. Important String Operations

* Traversing a string
* Finding length
* Reversing a string
* Checking palindrome
* Counting characters
* Substring extraction
* Comparing strings

---

## 3. Time Complexity Basics

* Traversing string → **O(n)**
* Reversing string → **O(n)**
* Checking palindrome → **O(n)**

## 4. Sample Workouts

### Workout 1 — Reverse a String

**Question:**
Given a string `s`, reverse the string and return the result.

**Example:**

```
Input: "hello"

**Example:**

```
Input: "madam"
Output: true
```

**Your Solution:**

```
```
