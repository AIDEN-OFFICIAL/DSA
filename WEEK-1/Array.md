# ğŸ“˜ Arrays in JavaScript

## ğŸ§© What is an Array?

An **array** is a linear data structure used to store multiple values in a single variable.  
It stores **elements of the same or different types** in a **contiguous memory block**, allowing efficient indexing and traversal.

```js
let arr = [10, 20, 30, 40];
```
